ðŸš§ **It's currently under incubating...**

A monitor & controller for Android sensitive permissions/api calls based on bytecode transformation.

It supports adding custom proxy rules to intercept sensitive api calls with a single annotation like below:

```kotlin
object ActivityProxy {
    @CaliperMethodProxy(
        className = "android/app/Activity",
        methodName = "requestPermissions",
        opcode = ASMOpcodes.INVOKEVIRTUAL
    )
    @JvmStatic
    fun requestPermissions(activity: Activity, permissions: Array<String>, requestCode: Int) {
        activity.requestPermissions(permissions, requestCode)
    }
}
```

Now all `Activity#requestPermissions` calls will be forwarded to the proxy method.

## Integration

Please navigate to [Integration Guide](./integration.md) for full details.
