# Caliper

ðŸš§ **It's currently under incubating...**

A monitor for Android Sensitive Permission/API based on bytecode transformation.

Inspired by [allenymt/PrivacySentry](https://github.com/allenymt/PrivacySentry).

## Quick Start

**0x01. Add the plugin to classpath:**

``` kotlin
// Option 1.
// Add `mavenCentral` to `pluginManagement{}` on `settings.gradle.kts` (or the root `build.gradle.kts`),
// and then the caliper plugin id.
pluginManagement {
	repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
    }
    plugins {
    	...
    	id("me.2bab.caliper") version "0.1.0" apply false
    }
}

// Option 2.
// Using classic `buildscript{}` block in root build.gradle.kts.
buildscript {
    repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath("me.2bab:caliper:0.1.0")
    }
}
```
